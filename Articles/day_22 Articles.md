afterwards i learnt about  while loop syntax- A  while loop is a used to executes a block of code at least once or then repeately it executes the block.

afterwards i learnt about for loop syntax- A loop is used for executing a block of statements repeatedly until a particular condition is satisfied.

main difference for while loop and for loop- In while loop we should defined the variable separately in while loop syntax.
for example let=a, let i=0, while(i>a), i=1+1.

In for loop we should defined the variable in one function itself. for example- for(let a=1, i<a, i++).
