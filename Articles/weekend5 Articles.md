## Weekend-5 Articles

On fifth week I learnt about Array, Object, while loop, for loop, if condition these things are i learnt in this fifth week.

Array- 

	* array is a collecting of any type of data.
	* array it contains the primitive data type are string, number,boolean
	* it has a composite datatype- combination of one or more types.
	* syntax of array should be in square bracket example- library= [a,b,c...]
	* Data stored in the array start with the indec of Zero example- let a= [0.1,2,3,...]
	* we can create, delete, update and read.

Object-

	* The object is the collection of key-value
	* the object will start with curly brackets for example-{a,b,c..}
	* it can be accessible through object keys

I learnt about the syntax of object and Array. object syntax- pb-ida-pk-value-ps-pb-pt, Array syntax- pa- value-ps-pa-pt and I learnt about the cache and cookies.

## Cache memory 

* Cache memory is a high-speed memory, which is small in size.

* It acts as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory.

* It holds the data and programs which are frequently used by the CPU.

uses of cache memory:

* Your computer saves files from sites that you visit online

* When you have a cached copy of a website, it will load faster

* Will cause problems if the cache has an old version of a file

Once if the cache is cleared in your system,In your browser to run a little slower than usual after clearing your cache.

There are three types of cache:
* Level1 [L1]
* Level2 [L2]
* Level3 [L3]

And I learnt how to prepare the presentation while i am preparing for presentation i faced some difficulties in creating the ppt. afterwards i taken some notes for how to present it and also i am preparing for it.

afterwards i learnt about  while loop syntax- A  while loop is a used to executes a block of code at least once or then repeately it executes the block.

afterwards i learnt about for loop syntax- A loop is used for executing a block of statements repeatedly until a particular condition is satisfied.

main difference for while loop and for loop- In while loop we should defined the variable separately in while loop syntax.
for example let=a, let i=0, while(i>a), i=1+1.

In for loop we should defined the variable in one function itself. for example- for(let a=1, i<a, i++).

I am practicing some problems in while loop.I have learned the basic of javascript ,How object and array works in a program .I have learned that array can store values of any datatype(primitive) , so arrays consist of strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other arrays.

And I learnt about the responsibility- Responsibility is owning a choice is a responsibility.

Maslow's hierarchy- The maslow's hierarchy is a basic needs of human.

There are five stages of maslow's hierarchy, they are:

	* self-actualization
	* esteem
	* love and belonging
	* safety
	* physiological

**self actualization**- morality, creativity, spontaneity, problem solving, lack of prejudice, acceptance of facts.

**Esteem**-self-esteem, confidence, achievement, respect of others, respect by others

**Love/Belonging**- friendship, family, sexual

**Safety**- security of body, of employment, of resources, of morality, of the family, of health, of property

**Physiological**- breathing, food, water, sex, sleep, homeostasis, excretion

afterwards we formed into a group and we discussed about senario in that the first senario was-"person given a task more than he/she thinks can handle/manage".

In this senario there are five category of acruisition of skills , the category are:

Acruisition of skills

1. Impulsive skills
2. Imperial mind
3. Socialised mind
4. Self authoring mind
5. Self tranforming mind


Impulsive skills- they will try doing this task, if excited them or boy else they move on to the next task, dispite of completing a previous task.

Imperial mind- he will justify himself irrespective of completing or not completing a work when we manipulate the work. 

Socialised mind-  he will project himself in a way to everyone's favour,he cares about what other people might thinks so he won't have his own way of doing things.

Self authoring mind- they wll find the possible ways, they will seek help if they needs, he will be good in operating mode, he will analyse what it takes to complete the task.

Self tranforming mind- the person will be seff transforming mind in any one of his character, but not every one.

**stages of psychological development**

1. serving
2. interating
3. self actualising
4. individuating
5. differentiating
6. conforming
7. surviving

serving- it means that serving people around you

interating- create group with people who share your purpose value

self actualising- find you sense of purpose value

individuating- break individual who we are

differentiating- identify the difference

conforming- you want to fit in any one does

surviving- to be satisfacation

In a Adult is a Person who doesn't needs oothers what to do itself directive can navigate a cross seamingly Completing  idea and Prespective without subsuming their own and can develop Authentic mature relationship with others.

**Self authorship**- seft means be your self and authorship means Creation

* Defining and reshaping (Authorship)
* what you belive (Epistemoloay)
* Your sense of self (Identity intra personal)
* And your relationship with other (inter personal)

i learnt about the "if statement"- if statement  is the condition we applying in the programing and it will say the true or false, ifthe true the program will execute otherwise we should use 'else' statement or we should use 'if else' but mostely we should not use else atatement or if else statements.

else statements- The else statements is the programming condition and it will use it in 'if statements' if the condition is false it will execute in the else statement

if else statements- The if else statements is the programming condition and it will use it in 'if statements' if the condition is false it will execute in the if else statement and it will execute for more conditions.
