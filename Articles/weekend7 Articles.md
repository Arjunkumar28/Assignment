On seventh week I learnt  little bit about dart language and In function i learnt the (name, parameters(arguments), function body, return type) in java script.

we should give any one name to the function in programming language, after that we should give the parameters or arguments. A parameter is a named variable passed into a function. Parameter variables are used to import arguments into functions.

function body means that it is used to execute the sub program and return type is used to a particular value in a function.

In dart language we should use void main compulsory without the void main the program will not run in the dart, but in javascript the program will execute. with void main also program will run in java script and without void main also the program will run. java script will not bother about the void main.

In java script we use "number, string, array, console.log" instead of this in dart we are using "int, string, list, print".


And I learned the Scope of block will works and execution stack for functions. Afterthat I learnt about **UI** -User interface,Design,frames and figma framework basics.

**Execution stack for function:**

In main block gives the value before starting the function. if function does not have any value it takes from main block like that main block gives the values for all upcomming function and function will not take the value in before function.

In scope I learnt about working of function , execution of function. After that i am doing some office work. 

**User Interface:**

User interface is which we interact with computer is User Interface. Based on our project we designed the App layouts. By using figma we can create any type of layouts. In figma,rectangle is the only shape to design the layouts. By edge of rectangle only can drag to form a circle.

In dribbble layouts website there are lot of layouts. First step is make an layout with boxex as main footer and title navigator,bottom footer. After the boxes created start the code it will match to the layout. Blocks can be created using rows and columns.

For Design the layout: 1.Boxes need to create where the header,footer and main content will to be design. 2.Data structure like tree structure has rows and columns which we will call inside the pages and buttons.

Basic tags of html 1.navigate 2.hyperlink 3.button 4.division 5.image

1. Navigate: It is used for navigate from one page to another page.

2. Hyperlink: we can link the website url in the page.

3. Button It is used for the navigate into another link. 

4. Division: It is used for divide the spacing on text and headers. 

5. Image It is used for add the image location in this tag.
