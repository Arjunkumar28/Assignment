## Day2 Experience in Internship_surfboard Payments
     * On day2 morning we wakes up at nearly 5'clock in morning and we written assignment about what we learnt in day1 classes.
     * After we went to office at nearly 9'clock in morning and we had the morning breakfast in the office.
     * Daily we are learning something useful to our carrier path and we are getting good experience in Surfboard Payments.
     * I am very much happy to be parth of Surfboard payments.
     * In morning session we had one puzzle question to solve,
step to solve the puzzle:
     First we should understand the puzzle, for understanding we should read the puzze two or three times otherwise read untill you understandthe puzzle, we should not avoid the puzzle, Then we should identify list the constraints. we should list all the possible operation while solving the puzzle, Then we should arrange the operation to form a solution.

The question is-"A man went on a trip with a fox, a goose and a sack of corn. He came upon a stream which he had to cross and found a tiny boat to use to cross the stream. He could only take himself and one other - the fox, the goose, or the corn - at a time. He could not leave the fox alone with the goose or the goose alone with the corn".

Answer for the Question is-"Take the goose over first and come back. Then take the fox over and bring the goose back. Now take the corn over and come back alone to get the goose. Take the goose over and the job is done".
## Problem solving and Mathematical Thinking
  solution for Problem soving

     * First we should understand the problems, for understanding we should read the problems two or three times otherwise read untill you und       erstand the problem.
     * we should not avoid the problems.
     * Then we should identify list the constraints.
     * we should list all the possible operation while solving the problem.
     * Then we should arrange the operation to form a solution.
  
  These are the step to find a solution for problem solving.
  The question is- Arrange the numbers 1-35 sum of any two numbers to get perfect square
  Answer for this is- Arrange all of the digits from the numbers 1 through 35 in such a order that the sum of any adjacent pair is a perfect square.There is no repeats.We should use some strategy and tricks to solve the problem.
  Rules to solve the sudoku:
     First we should understand the sudoku,vertical and horizontal numbers should be 1-9 there should not be any repetation,then we should filled the all boxes.
Afterwards we had some fun while doing the problems and we had some break time like Tea and coffee,then we continued to solve a problem after an hour we had the lunch break,then afternoon session started.
 **Solution for Mathematical Thinking:**

     * we should find a way for mathematical thinking-its should be most constrained part.
     * Then we should try the trail and error method while doing the sum.
     * Afterwards break down the problems while doing the sum.
     * Finally we should apply the correct strategy to do the sum,then we can able to find a solution for the sum.

These are the some step to find a solution for mathematical thinking.
Then mentor gives the puzzle to solve,in this totally 9 boxes in the order of  3x3 matrix,then we should arrange the numbers 1-8 in correct manner
    
     * First we should find  the identify the train
     * Rotate the clockwise or anticlockwise untill we reach the terminals.
     * Then figure out the correct puzzle to find the answer.

Afterwards we had some tea break and coffee break at evening and we had some fun in bread time,then evening session started.
### Installing the git application in linux/ubuntu
If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so through the package management tool that comes with your distribution. If youâ€™re on Fedora (or any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS).
  "$ sudo apt install git-all"
 Step to sign up the git:

     * Go to browser and sign up in github, the website is" www.github.com/signup".
     * Then we should create an account in github.
     * Afterwards we should create a respository in github account, The name should be 'Assignment'
     * Go to Terminals create a folder name as 'Assignment'
     * Then go inside the assignment folder, we should create another folder as 'Articles'
     * After creating articles folder, go inside the articles folder
     * we should create a text file in MD formet

on day1,I saved the file in .txt formet,after i am using the pwd and rename command to changed into .txt to .md file formet and for its takes the long time to change. for some other person it comes lots of error, afterwards mentors try to solve the error. 
we should give some command in terminals
     "git init"
     "git remote add orgin"
go back to github account and copy the url and paste it in the terminals in 'git remote add orgin URL'
after give the command "git pull"
                       "git config --global user.name "Arjunkumar28""
                       "git config --global user.email "arjunbalu.1998@gmail.com""
afer completing all the step, By using the terminals we should upload the artices in the githut account.
The commands are "git add"
                 "git commit -m "day1\ Articles"
                 "git push orgin main' or use "git push -u orgin HEAD:main"
while working this command"git push orgin main",its occurs the error in linux and ubuntu software, instead of these command we used the another command is"git push -u orgin HEAD:main"
These Command are directly upload the every day essay in github by using the Terminals.

on first day i reached the nearly 700 words to write the essay and Second day essay i am trying to reach 1000 words and day by day i am improving the skils.thank you for giving me this wonderfull chance to improve my knowledge.
