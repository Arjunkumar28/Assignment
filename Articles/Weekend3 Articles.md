## Weekend-3 Articles

I learnt about the why the all languages having space between the words? All languages having space in between the words, because the we can understand the words properly and all space will having the identity in a unique space.

In before days tamil is the only one language is available, from tamil language they seperated into many languages likely Malayalam and Telugu 
## Theory of languages

In first they are created the the symbols/glyphs- These are the letters, after that symbols/gyphs they created the tokens that called as a words, after creation of tokens, they created the blocks. The blocks are contains the sentences in sentences they created the paragraph. In paragraph will have the space and new line space, after the paragraph it changes to pages, In pages is modified into chapters.

How they read the language without space in before days-

In before days they used some blocks to read the continue sentence without space.

Tirukkural- Each kural or couplet contains exactly seven words, known as cirs, with four cirs on the first line and three on the second, following the kural metre. A cir is a single or a combination of more than one Tamil word. For example, the term Tirukkuṟaḷ is a cir formed by combining the two words tiru and kural.

## C and C++

And I learnt about the basic difference between Procedure oriented programming language and object oriented programming language.

**Procedure oriented programming language**

procedure oriented programming. A programming paradigm that is based upon the concept of procedure calls and in the case of to develope a any application for a program.

* The program is divided into small parts is called function, In the case procedure oriented programming language to develop a program we have to divide the total program into some several number of parts and each and every parts ia called as function.

* The procedure oriented programming follows the Top-dowm approach in program design, In case of this the main program are executed in front after that sub program are executed and the program follows the Top to bottom.

* In procedure oriented language the program will start with high level language and end with low level language.

* The function and data can be written seperately and variable should be declared at the begining 

* There are no access modifiers in procedure programming

* Function can communicate by passing the parameters

* The case sensitive will differentiate the uppercase and lowercase

* semicolon are used to seperate the lines

* The curly braces used for to identify the loop and some condition

* In procedural language does not have any proper way of hiding data, so it is less secure, In case of we have to send the data one place to another place the data can be send in the form of plain text

The object oriented programming is a programming language in the concept of object.

* In object oriented programming to develope an application for a program we will use object and class

* In this program the object is divided into several number of parts and each part is called as an object

**object oriented programming language**

* The object  oriented programming follows the Bottom-up  approach in program design, In case first we should defined the class after that we should create an object for a class but program will run in the main function, the main function is called as object so its called as bottom up approach

* In procedure oriented language the program will start with low level language and end with high level language.

* The function and data are combined together form an object and variable should be declared at any where

* The object oriented programming has access modifiers are public, private, protected.

* Function can communicate with each other by passing the message

* The case sensitive will differentiate the uppercase and lowercase

* semicolon are used to seperate the lines

* The curly braces used for to identify the loop and some condition

* In object oriented programming provides data hiding, so it is more secure, In case of we have to send the data one place to a
nother place the data can be send in the form of plain text and it converted into cipher text.

## Computer

And, I learnt about working of computer

## History of Instagram

And, I learnt about history of instagram.

* Instagram was founded in 2010 by Stanford graduates Kevin Systorm and Mike Krieger.

* On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a US$500,000 seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.

* In January 2011, Instagram added hashtags to help users discover both photographs and each other. Instagram encourages users to make tags both
specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like "photo," to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users.

* Facebook made an offer to purchase Instagram, along with its 13 employees, for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock in April 2012, with a plan to keep the company independently managed. Since the app's launch it had used the Foursquare API to provide named
location tagging.

* In early 2014, after being purchased by Facebook, the company was switched to using Facebook Places.
