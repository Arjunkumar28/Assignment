Telegram for business has cloud storage, which means all your texts, images, files, videos and documents will be saved on the cloud. There is no tension of losing the data. You can backup and restore the data when required.

These things are i learnt from this telegram, after that i learnt some html command to build my resume in html formet and created and uploadedin github.

In every languages having the Character set of ASCII and UNICODE without this computer can't run, In computer every things comes under the form of binary system , without the binary this system can't able to run.

Every character in alphabet it contains the ASII code and Every Symbols it contains the UNICODE.

I learnt and I got some clarity to solve problems and writing algorithm for both we should have some basic step and tips to follow it.
step:

	* First we should understand the problems, for understanding we should read the problems two or three times otherwise read untill you understand the problem.
	* we should not avoid the problems.
	* Then we should identify list the constraints.
	* we should list all the possible operation while solving the problem.
	* Then we should arrange the operation to form a solution.
tips:

	* we should find a way for the problems and its should be most constrained part.
	* Then we should try the trail and error method while doing the sum.
	* Afterwards break down the problems while doing the sum.
	* Then we should apply the correct strategy to do the sum,then we can able to find a solution for the sum.
	* Finally look for analogies.

These are the basic step we should follow, this is not only for solving problems, writing algorithm and this step we can apply it in any where for example apply in life, person problem, etc.

In this i learnt that while solving problems and writing algorithm we should practice more and more, then we can get the confident to solve any problems.
