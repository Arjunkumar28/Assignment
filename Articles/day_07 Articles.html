<h2> Day- 7 Articles </h2>

<p>
On day-7 i am learning about the what is scripting language? A scripting language is a programming language. It is translated into machine code when the code is run, rather than beforehand. Scripting languages are often used for short scripts over full computer programs. JavaScript, Python, and Ruby are all examples of scripting languages.

i am learning about DOT language,DOT is a graph description language. DOT graphs are typically files with the filename extension gv or dot.Various programs can process DOT files. Some, such as dot, neato, twopi, circo, fdp, and sfdp, can read a DOT file and render it in graphical form. Others, such as gvpr, gc, acyclic, ccomps, sccmap, and tred, read DOT files and perform calculations on the represented graph.

<h3> Algorithm </h3>
<p>
Algorithm is the set of rules to be followed in computer and it is used for problem solving.

<h3> Problem Solving </h3>

<p>
The mentor discussing about problem solving.

</p> <p>
The first question was- one galleons is equal to 17 sickles and one sickles is equal to 29 knuts. The harry potter has lot of money in galleons, 5000 sickles and 500 knuts, He want to buy broomstick cost of 25 galleons and he can use upto one third money in galleons and knuts is preferred than sickles.

</p> <p>
Algorithm for this problems was:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> Start </li>
	<li> step1- store one galleons is equal to 17 sickles </li> 
	<li> step2- store one sickles is equal to 29 knuts </li>
	<li> step3- store the cost of broomstick in galleons </li>
	<li> step4- store 5000 sickles and 5000 knuts </li>
	<li> step5- use arithmetic operation to solve the problems </li>
	<li> step6- divide the 5000 sickles in step1 </li>
	<li> step7- store the output value as 'a' </li>
	<li> step8- divide the 5000 knuts in step2 </li>
	<li> step9- store the output value as 'b' </li>
	<li> step10- divide the stored value 'b' in step1 </li>
	<li> step11- store the value as 'c' </li>
	<li> step12- subtract the step3 with stored value 'c' </li>
	<li> step13- store the value as 'd' </li>
	<li> step14- multiply the stored value 'd' with step1 </li>
	<li> step15- store the value as 'e' </li> 
	<li> Stop </li>
</ul>
<p>
The second question is-
</p> <p>
Table should be put at the corner <br>
Table should be cheap <br>
It is able to sit four to six people <br>
It should not draw attention <br>
</p> 

<table style="width 70"> 
<tr>
	<th> option |</th>
	<th> cost | </th>
	<th> seating | </th>
	<th> size in [m^2] </th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th> 1 </th>
	<th> 600 </th>
	<th> 6 </th>
	<th> 2.5 </th>
</tr>
<tr>
        <th> 2 </th>
	<th> 500 </th>
        <th> 4 </th>
        <th> 1.5 </th>
</tr>
<tr>
        <th> 3 </th>
	<th> 550 </th>
        <th> 5 </th>
        <th> 2 </th>
</tr>
<tr>
        <th> 4 </th>
        <th> 450 </th>
        <th> 6 </th>
        <th> 4 </th>
</tr>
<tr>
        <th> 5 </th>
        <th> 300 </th>
        <th> 4 </th>
        <th> 2 </th>
</tr>
<tr>
        <th> 6 </th>
        <th> 550 </th>
        <th> 5 </th>
        <th> 2 </th>
</tr> 
</table>
<p>
Algorithm for this problems was:
</p>
<ul>
        <li> Start </li>
	<li> step1- store all option value as 'o' </li>
	<li> step2- store all the cost value </li>
	<li> step3- store all the seating value </li>
	<li> step4- store all the size value in metersquare </li>
	<li> step5- arrange all the cost value in ascending order </li>
	<li> step6- store the cost value as 'a' </li>
	<li> step7- arrange all the seating value in ascending order </li>
	<li> step8- store the seating value as 'b' </li>
	<li> step9- arrange all the size value in ascending order </li>
	<li> step10- store the size value as 'c' </li>
	<li> step11- store all the 'o,a,b,c' value in z </li>
	<li> step12- take all the same size value in 'c' stored in z </li>
	<li> step13- select the lowest seating value in 'b' stored in z </li>
	<li> Stop </li>
</ul>
<p>
The third question is- TOM to reach the JERRY,  The TOM is used to find a shortest way to reach the JERRY by using the nodes.The nodes having a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i.

</p> <p>
Algorithm for this problems was:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> Start </li>
	<li> step1- list out all the possible path 'a to i" </li>
	<li> step2- store the value as 'z' </li>
	<li> step3- arrange the stored value'z'in ascending order </li>
	<li> step4- select the shortest path in stored value 'z'</li>
	<li> step5- guide the TOM to reach the JERRY in shortest path </li>
	<li> Stop </li>
</ul>
