The leader must have first look in the mirror at themselves. leader should not blame others who are working in below level and leader should take the full responsibility for any risk and any problems. leaders must train and mentor underperformers, but if they cannot improve, the leader must remain loyal to the team and replace them. leaders must look at problems through the lens of reality, without emotional attachments. The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win.

Total responsibility for failure is a difficult thing to accept, and taking ownership when things goes wrong. But the leader must known the absolute necessity to learning, growing as a leader.

THE LAWS OF COMBAT:Cover And Move simply means teamwork. Groups within the team must depend on each other and understand who depends on them.

Each team member is critical to success. When a team fails, everyone fails. When a team wins, everyone wins.

Life has layers of complexities, and simplifying as much as possible is critical to success. Plans must be communicated simply. If your team doesn't get it, you have not kept things simple and you have failed. It is critical that frontline troops are able to ask questions to clarify when they don't understand. Leaders must encourage this communication and ensure the lowest common denominator on the team understands.

Countless problems compound in a snowball effect, but a leader must remain calm and make the best decisions possible.To do this, leaders must prioritize and execute. Even the best leaders can be overwhelmed tackling multiple problems at once. Instead, determine the highest priority task and execute, then move to the next. Stay 1-2 steps ahead of problems and plan for contingencies to enable swift execution. Don't let the focus on one priority cause target fixation, maintain ability to shift attention.

Teams must be broken down into 4-5 operators with a clearly designated leader. Junior leaders must be empowered to make decisions on key tasks and understand what is within their decision making authority. Constant communication up and down the chain of command is imperative to mission success. Leaders must be free to move where they are most needed, which changes through an operation.
