## Day-20 Articles

On day-20 I learnt about data, The data is the collecting the information in data they are three types of primitive data types are available 
string, number,boolean and another one data types are available that is novalue data types.

string- the string contains the number or a character is known as string, for example "hello india" and "Arjun003".

Number- The number is used to store the value in numericals in in the form of binary form and number is also one type of datatype.

Boolean- The boolean used to compare and tell whether the true or false and In programming the boolean having different syntax in each language, in java script it represented the true or false.

And i learnt about compiler and interpreter, they are the translator and it will convert the high level to the the machine code.

The each computer having the compiler/Interpreters. The compiler and interpreter also a one kind of programming. The interpreter is also called as translator and all comes under the binary form zero and once. for example C compiler is written in c language ang java script compiler is written in java script. the most of the programming languages are written in same language.

The compiler program is basically four major blocks are

	* Tokeniser and lexical analysis
	* syntatic analysis
	* sematic analysis
	* code generation

data encapsulation- The data encapsulation is on of the some action requires in the programming for example switch is in ON and OFF state

And i learnt about the data structure, The data structure is the collection of array and string. we should defined the each object while structuring the any object,for example of data structure are table,library,conference room, like etc.

And the data structure is the one kind of design of any object.

Array- 

	* array is a collecting of any type of data.
	* array it contains the primitive data type are string, number,boolean
	* it has a composite datatype- combination of one or more types.
	* syntax of array should be in square bracket example- library= [a,b,c...]
	* Data stored in the array start with the indec of Zero example- let a= [0.1,2,3,...]
	* we can create, delete, update and read.

Object-

	* The object is the collection of key-value
	* the object will start with curly brackets for example-{a,b,c..}
	* it can be accessible through object keys

And finally i learnt some command in the html and I also build my resume in html formet.
