## Day-25 Articles

On Day25 i learnt about the "if statement"- if statement  is the condition we applying in the programing and it will say the true or false, ifthe true the program will execute otherwise we should use 'else' statement or we should use 'if else' but mostely we should not use else atatement or if else statements.

else statements- The else statements is the programming condition and it will use it in 'if statements' if the condition is false it will execute in the else statement

if else statements- The if else statements is the programming condition and it will use it in 'if statements' if the condition is false it will execute in the if else statement and it will execute for more conditions.

example for if statements-

arrange in  even number

	* let arr=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
	* let i=0;
	* while(i<arr.length)
	* {
	* if(arr[i]%2====0)
	* {
	* i++;
	* }

And I learnt that we should not use double equal to and we should use the trible equal to, sometime double equal to will not work in program ant it gives the wrong output, for example  "1==true:true" and "1===true:false" 

After that i am learnt about the some library function that function we can used it while coding the programming. The library function are:

* .shift()
* .pop()
* .push()
* .unshift()

* .shift()- it is used to push the first element out.
* .pop()- it is used to push the last element out.
* .push()- it is used to put an elements at the end of the array.
* .unshift()- puts an elements atthe beginning of the array.

After that i am practicing some in while loop
 


* let sum=[[0,1,2],[2,3,4]] 
* let n=0;
* let i=sum[0].length;
* let fr=[];
* let fr1=[];
* let fr2=[];
* while(n<i)
* {
* s1=sum[0][n]+sum[1][n];
* fr[n]=s1
* n++
* }
* console.log(fr);
* n=0;
* while(n<i)
* {
* s2=sum[0][n]-sum[1][n];
* fr1[n]=s2
* n++
* }
* console.log(fr1);

* n=0;
* while(n<i)
* {
* n1=sum[0][n]+sum[1][n];
* n2=sum[0][n]-sum[1][n];
* fr2[n]=n1*n2;
* n++
* }
* console.log(fr2);

* arg=[-4,-8,-12];
* n=0;
* fr3=0;
* while(n<arg.length)
* {
* fr3=fr3+arg[n];
* n++
* }
* console.log(fr3);

output is-

[2, 4, 6]
[-2, -2, -2]
[-4, -8, -12]
 -24

* step1- start
* step2- set any one variable name for that variable name assign the some number in array
* step3- set initial value as Zero for that initial value set any one character,for example n=0
* step4- defined the length in an array set any one character for it.
* step5- set the the empty array in diferent variable name
* step6- Then apply the while loop condition for sum, difference,multiplication(sum x difference),find the average for multiplication
* step7- In first while loop condition find the sum of the array, then
* step8- set the initial value as zero
* step9- In second while loop condition find the difference for an array, then
* step10- again set the initial value as zero
* step11- In third while loop condition find the multiplication of sum and difference for an array, then
* step12- set the multiplied value in one array for that assign the variable name to it
* step13- In fourth while loop condition find the average for the multiplied value
* step14- finally execute and display the output.
* step15- stop
