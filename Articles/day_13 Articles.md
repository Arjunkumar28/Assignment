# Day-13 Articles

On DAy-13, I am learning about the Basic of computer and we are discussing the answer which is given in previous week assignments

we are discussing the four sums, I solved the one problems the question is-

In the great temple of brahma inbenares, india on a brass plate under the dome that msarks the centre of yhe world. there are 64t of pure gold that the priests carry one at a time between threee diamond needles according to brahma's immutable law- no disk may be placed on a small disk. In the begining of the world all 64 disks formed the tower of brahma on one needle. Now, however the process of transfer of the tower from one needle to another is in mid course.when the lst disk is finally in place, once again forming the tower of brahma but on s diggerent needle, then will come the end of the world and all will turn to the dust.

The solution for the problem-

1. Move the disk1 A to B
2. Move the disk2 A to C
3. Move the disk1 B to C
4. Move the disk3 A to B
5. Move the disk1 C to A
6. Move the disk2 C to B
7. Move the disk1 A to B
8. Move the disk4 A to C
9. Move the disk1 B to C
10. Move the disk2 B to A
11. Move the disk1 C to A
12. Move the disk3 B to C
13. Move the disk1 A to B
14. Move the disk2 A to C
15. Move the disk1 B to C

This is for 4 tower we should calculate by using the formula 2^n-1,2^4-1 this answer for tower,like this we should calculate for 64 disk, the answer for 64 disk is 2^64-1.After that we done some activities 

## Basic of Computer

## What is computer?

A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. A computer consists of four major parts.

**The four major parts are:**

        * Input
        * Output
        * CPU-[Central Processing Unit]
        * Memory

1. Input consists of nothing but you will add into the computer
        * Microphone
        * Keyboard
        * Mouse
        * Scanner,etc...
2. Output- A computer gives back to you is called output. Example for out put is speaker and printer.
3. The CPU- Central Processing Unit is located on the motherboard and it is the part of computer where the all the information get sent to the proper place. The motherboard is the most important part of a computer and it contains many subsystem such as CPU, input, output and chip.

**Functional components of a computer**
The every task given to a computer follows an input-process-output its called as IPO cycle

The input unit takes the input, the central processing unit does the processing of data and the output unit is produces the output.

**components of CPU**
        ALU- Arithmetic and logic unit
        Control unit
        Internal memory unit

ALU- The ALU performs arithmetic operation such as addition,subtraction,multiplication,division, logigal operations and the result of an operation is stored in internal memory of CPU

Control unit- The control unit controls the flow of data between the cpu, memory and input/output devices. it also controls the entire operation of a computer

Internal Memory unit- internal memeory is the smallest and fastest memory located in the CPU in the form of Registers.


4. Memory- There are two types of memory,they are-
        1. Primary memory
        2. Secondary memory

Primary memory is used to temporary storage the program and data, the primary memory is commonly referred to as RAM- Random Access Memory and ROM- Read Only Memory.The RAM is volatile memory and it can able to read and write

Secondary memory is used to store the data permanently, secondary memory commanly referred as ROM-Read only memory and it  is the non volatile memory and it can able to read only.

**External devices that connected to the motherboard**

        * Monitor
        * Keyboard
        * Mouse
        * Printer

* Monitor is a electronic devices and it is used to display the screen

* A mouse a small hardware input devices and its used by hand, it controls the movement of the cursor on the computer screen.

## uses of Mouse

**Move the Mouse Cursor**- It is the primary function is to move the mouse pointer on the screen.

**Point**- Once the mouse is moved you can able to pointout somethings. Example In computer games you can use the mouse to point a gun in the direction.

**Open**- while using the pointer we can able to clicking or double clicking that object use to open the documents.

**Select**- A mouse also allows you to select text or a file or highlight and select the multiple files at once.
                                                                                                                           
**Drag and Drop**- once something is selected,it can also be moved using drag and drop method.

**Scroll**- When we are working with a long documents or viewing a long web page, we should scroll up and down.

* A keyboard is one of the primary input devices used with a computer and key contains button used to create letter,number and symbols and it performs additional function.

## uses of keyboard

**Enter key**- The enter key used to ends a line or paragraph of text. While searching something in browser we should give the enter key.

**Cursor/Arrow**- In keyboard it contains the four arrow keys pressesd along to move the cursor on screen one line or character.

**Escapse (ESC)**- Commonly used to exit or cancle the current mode such as exiting from a menu, the ESC key may also be used to clear the screen.

**Numeric lock**- if we on the number lock key we can able to type a only the number.

**Home key and End key**- commonly used to move the cursor to the left or right side of the current line or to the top and bottom of a documents offen used with a modifier key.

**page up and page down**- This is used to move the cursor up and down a page.

**Backspace key**- The backspace key is used to erase the character to the left of the cursor.
