## Day- 18 Articles

On day 18, I learnt about the html command to build my resume in html formet while doing the html command i am facing many difficulties ater that i got some clarity.

And i am learning about what is data, the data is  collecting the information and specific about data are three types- Not needed (noise),
useful for context, what is needed for the algorithm to work and algorithm is also one kind of data.

After that i learnt about the relationship between data and operation. there is another three types of data are string, number, boolean these are called primitive data type because primitive data types are fundamental that we think of  and another one data type is called Novalue- it s null and undefined.i learnt about variable, the variable is used to store the value in a memory. 

And we learnt about the tokens for example-'Anoop is not giving me a coffee' this the one kind of sentence but tokens are Anoop, is , not, giving, me, a, coffee. these are the tokens after that we seperate into blocks.

The each computer having the compiler/Interpreters. The compiler and interpreter also a one kind of program. The interpreter is also called as translator and all comes under the binary form zero and once. for example C compiler is written in c language ang java script compiler is written in java script. the most of the programming languages are written in same language.

The compiler program is basically four major blocks are

	* Tokeniser and lexical analysis
	* syntatic analysis
	* sematic analysis
	* code generation

 
Tokeniser and lexical analysis- The tokeniser will break down into blocks and lexical analysis after break down it will check the meaning of the each tokens is having meaning or not.Example for tokenisor-'Anoop is not giving me a coffee' this the one kind of sentence but tokens are Anoop, is , not, giving, me, a, coffee. these are the tokens after that we seperate into blocks.


syntatic analysis- The syntatic analysis is one kind of structure and it will check the noun, verb, object, like etc. for example anoop felt ice cream

sematic analysis- The sematic analysis will check if any sentence does not having any meaning it will indicate the error, if the sentence having the meaning it will not indicate the error, after that the code will generate to next level.
