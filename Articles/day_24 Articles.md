## Day-24 Articles

On day24 iam learning and practicing the some problem in while loop condition

The problem was to find sum, difference, multiplication of sum and difference and aggregate

let sum=[[0,1,2],[2,3,4]] 
let n=0;
let i=sum[0].length;
let fr=[];
let fr1=[];
let fr2=[];
while(n<i)
{
s1=sum[0][n]+sum[1][n];
fr[n]=s1
n++
}
console.log(fr);
n=0;
while(n<i)
{
s2=sum[0][n]-sum[1][n];
fr1[n]=s2
n++
}
console.log(fr1);

n=0;
while(n<i)
{
n1=sum[0][n]+sum[1][n];
n2=sum[0][n]-sum[1][n];
fr2[n]=n1*n2;
n++
}

output is-

[2, 4, 6]
[-2, -2, -2]
[-4, -8, -12]


And I learnt about the responsibility- Responsibility is owning a choice is a responsibility.

Maslow's hierarchy- The maslow's hierarchy is a basic needs of human.

There are five stages of maslow's hierarchy, they are:

	* self-actualization
	* esteem
	* love and belonging
	* safety
	* physiological

**self actualization**- morality, creativity, spontaneity, problem solving, lack of prejudice, acceptance of facts.

**Esteem**-self-esteem, confidence, achievement, respect of others, respect by others

**Love/Belonging**- friendship, family, sexual

**Safety**- security of body, of employment, of resources, of morality, of the family, of health, of property

**Physiological**- breathing, food, water, sex, sleep, homeostasis, excretion

afterwards we formed into a group and we discussed about senario in that the first senario was-"person given a task more than he/she thinks can handle/manage".

In this senario there are five category of acruisition of skills , the category are:

Acruisition of skills

1. Impulsive skills
2. Imperial mind
3. Socialised mind
4. Self authoring mind
5. Self tranforming mind


Impulsive skills- they will try doing this task, if excited them or boy else they move on to the next task, dispite of completing a previous task.

Imperial mind- he will justify himself irrespective of completing or not completing a work when we manipulate the work. 

Socialised mind-  he will project himself in a way to everyone's favour,he cares about what other people might thinks so he won't have his own way of doing things.

Self authoring mind- they wll find the possible ways, they will seek help if they needs, he will be good in operating mode, he will analyse what it takes to complete the task.

Self tranforming mind- the person will be seff transforming mind in any one of his character, but not every one.

**stages of psychological development**

1. serving
2. interating
3. self actualising
4. individuating
5. differentiating
6. conforming
7. surviving

serving- it means that serving people around you

interating- create group with people who share your purpose value

self actualising- find you sense of purpose value

individuating- break individual who we are

differentiating- identify the difference

conforming- you want to fit in any one does

surviving- to be satisfacation

In a Adult is a Person who doesn't needs oothers what to do itself directive can navigate a cross seamingly Completing  idea and Prespective without subsuming their own and can develop Authentic mature relationship with others.

**Self authorship**- seft means be your self and authorship means Creation

* Defining and reshaping (Authorship)
* what you belive (Epistemoloay)
