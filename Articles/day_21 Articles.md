## Day-21 Articles

On day-21 I learnt about the cache memory and cookies.

Cache memory- 

* Cache memory is a high-speed memory, which is small in size.

* It acts as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory.

* It holds the data and programs which are frequently used by the CPU.

uses of cache memory:

* Your computer saves files from sites that you visit online

* When you have a cached copy of a website, it will load faster

* Will cause problems if the cache has an old version of a file

Once if the cache is cleared in your system,In your browser to run a little slower than usual after clearing your cache.

There are three types of cache:
* Level1 [L1]
* Level2 [L2]
* Level3 [L3]

**Level-1 cache:**

* It is first level of cache.

* Memory is present inside the CPU itself.

* It can work at the same speed as of the CPU.

* Each core of CPU have its own level 1 cache.

**Level-2 cache:**

* It is second level of cache

* It can be present inside or outside the CPU.

* They are slower than L1.

* Each core of CPU can have its own L2 cache.

**Level-3 cache:**

* It is third level of cache

* It is located outside the CPU.

* It is slower than L1 & L2.

* It is shared by all the cores of a CPU.

## Cookies

The cookies are used to store in a text documents in your browser.

* One session means time between opening and closing of your browser.

* As the browser store in memory this cookies also stored in memory. As the browser goes out of memory the cookies also deleted.

* They are Stored for more than one browser session. Hence they are stored in hard drive.

* Persistent cookies stay with your browser even after you've exited it.

* The next time you open your browser and access the website that placed the cookie on your browser, it will find the cookie still there.

* For example, if the Web site you are on using third-party advertising those third-party advertising Web sites may use a cookie to track you
Web habits for marketing purposes.

And also it has one more cookies that is zombi cookies.

**Super or Zombi Cookie**

* Most Dangerous cookies.
* Some cookies are automatically recreated after a user has deleted them, these are called zombie cookies.

Array- 

	* array is a collecting of any type of data.
	* array it contains the primitive data type are string, number,boolean
	* it has a composite datatype- combination of one or more types.
	* syntax of array should be in square bracket example- library= [a,b,c...]
	* Data stored in the array start with the indec of Zero example- let a= [0.1,2,3,...]
	* we can create, delete, update and read.

Object-

	* The object is the collection of key-value
	* the object will start with curly brackets for example-{a,b,c..}
	* it can be accessible through object keys

After that we learnt about the syntax of object and Array

object syntax- pb-ida-pk-value-ps-pb-pt

Array syntax- pa- value-ps-pa-pt

Finally I am practicing the some syntax for Array and object in console.
