## Weekend Articles [First Week] 

On first day starting, we learnt about the basic fundamental skills to be a Engineer

	* Reading
	* Writing
	* Mathematical thinking
	* Problem solving
	* Researching
	* Breaking down and synthesing
	* Typing
	* Creativity

Afterwards we learnt that what are the rules to be followed to be a software engineer, step to follow
	
	* First step to follow the **Novice**,that means we should follow the rules compulsory.
	* Next step to follow the **Advance Beginer**
	* Afterwards the except will follow the rules and they will break down the rules in some times.

Then i learnt that some command in the terminal in linux software, the commands are list,copy,to create a folder,to remove a folder,go back to folder,to create a text file in terminals,like etc...

By using these commands YUM,SUDO,Wget i learnt that, How to install the some software by using the terminals command.

After that i learnt that how to create a account in github and how to create a directory inside the github, How to add the github account in the terminals, by using the terminals how to push the articles into the github and by using github commands in terminals.
 
Finally i learnt **How to power off the system by using the terminals commands**, The command is **telinit 0**.

## Problem solving and Mathematical Thinking
  
I learnt some step to solve the Problem solving, the steps are:

	* First we should understand the problems, for understanding we should read the problems two or three times otherwise read untill you understand the problem.
	* we should not avoid the problems.
	* Then we should identify list the constraints.
	* we should list all the possible operation while solving the problem.
	* Then we should arrange the operation to form a solution.

And i learnt some tips to find the solution for problem solving, the tips are:

	* we should find a way for the problems and its should be most constrained part.
	* Then we should try the trail and error method while doing the sum.
	* Afterwards break down the problems while doing the sum.
	* Then we should apply the correct strategy to do the sum,then we can able to find a solution for the sum.
	* Finally look for analogies.

## Markdown languages

I learnt that what is markdown languages and How to write it, What i was learnt in the markdown languages is- How to change the normal text into **BOLD**, *ITALIC* and ***BOLD ITALIC***.
In markdown languages, it contains the many rules and condition to apply for it.

	* In first step i learnt how to write in the heading, for that we should type the hash sign and we should give the one space, then we should type the headings, we should type the double ash and it will decrease the heading size, if we give the three hash in the heading and it decrease into small size. This what i lernt the condition for heading.
	* In second step i learnt how to write in the bold, In Markdown languages it don’t agree on how to handle underscores in the middle ofa word. its is compatibility to use asterisks to bold the middle of a word for emphasis.
	* In third step i learnt how to write in the italic, In markdown languages it don’t agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to italicize the middle of a word for emphasis.
	* In fourth step i learnt how to write in the bold italic, In markdown languages it don’t agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis.
	* In fifth step i learnt how to write the paragraph in markdown languages,To create a paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text,Unless the paragraph is in a list, don’t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

## Markup languages

I learnt that how to write the markup languages before that i don't know about the markup languages after coming to the intern i learnt that what is the markdown languages and i taught that markup languages and markdown languages are similar ,after that i got cleared that both are different laguages.The markup languages are XLM,HTML,YAML,JSON.Yesterday only i learnt that what are the markup language, in that i learnt that how to write the XLM-extensible markup languages like that all markup languages are similar only command will be changing. 

Afterwards we created the own markup languages, we seperated into a some group and discussion is went for some time after we created the our own markup language and we were explaining to the mentor that time we had lot of confussion while explaining that, cofussion went for an hour and finally we stoped the confussion.

Later they conducted the cultural tasks for an hour and they form an group to disscuss and tell about what is the difference between Responsibility and obligation and they convey the difference opinion in each group what i understood it the responsibility is the choosing some thing to do and the obligation i understood that some one is focing or giving some work to do, if they some one is forcing to do somethings, that time we should do it is in interest,if we do it in interest we can able to gain knowledge more and more.likewise I understood.
