## History

Instagram was founded in 2010 by Stanford graduates Kevin Systorm and Mike Krieger.


On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a US$500,000 seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.

In January 2011, Instagram added hashtags to help users discover both photographs and each other. Instagram encourages users to make tags both
specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like "photo," to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users.

Facebook made an offer to purchase Instagram, along with its 13 employees, for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock in April 2012, with a plan to keep the company independently managed. Since the app's launch it had used the Foursquare API to provide named
location tagging.

In early 2014, after being purchased by Facebook, the company was switched to using Facebook Places.
