## Day-14 Articles

On day14, I learnt about working of computer

MAIN PARTS OF COMPUTER

Input unit - Key Board, Mouse, Touch screen, Joystick

Output unit - Monitor, printer, Projector, Speaker Head Phone.

System unit - Processing data.

	* Core unit

	* Storage unit

	* Power unit

* Core Unit :

Mother Board, Processor, Ram

* Storage Unit :

[a] Permanent storage - Hard disk

[b] Removable storage - CD-ROM, CD-R/W, DVD & Pen drive.

* Power Unit :

SMPS (Switch Mode Power Supply) - For power Supply

**1.CORE UNIT**

**MOTHERBOARD:**

It contains the main pc circuit and chipset.

TYPES OF MOTHERBOARD:

1. XT - Extended technology

2. AT- Advance Technology

3. ATX - Advance Technology Extended

4. MATX Micro Advance Technology

**PROCESSOR:**

The processor which executes the program code and controls all other devices in PC and it is brain of a computer.

THERE ARE TWO TYPES:

1. SLOT TYPE (OR) CARD TYPE

2. SOCKET TYPE (OR) PIN TYPE, PINLESS

**MEMORY MODULES:**

RAM is the working space for the processor and it executes the programs.

TYPES OF MEMORY MODULES:

* S - RAM (Static RAM)
* D-RAM (Dynamic RAM) 

**2. STORAGE UNIT**

TYPES OF STORAGE DEVICES:

* Permanent storage: Hard drive

The devices which stores the data and programs

* Removable storage: Floppy drive, Other drive :CDROM Drives, DVD ROM, CD&DVD writer, Pen Drive

**3. POWER UNIT**

SMPS - Switch Mode Power Supply, It convert the voltage from 230 AC to 12 DC.

The module which supplies the DC power to the motherboard and all the units at the required voltages.

**PARTS OF MOTHER BOARD**

1. Chip Set

2. Processor socket

3. Memory modules & slots.

4. Expansion slot

5. Drive Connector

6. BIOS Chip

7. CMOS Battery

8. Front Panel

9. IO Port Connector

10. Power Connector

**CHIP SETS :**

A chip set consists of a group of IC which are in in the board. Now we are using two types of Chip set.

1. North Bridge Chipset:

It is located in-between the Processor and RAM. It is called as System Control Chip (or) Memory Controller hub.

2. South Bridge Chipset :

It is located away from the processor. It is called as Peripheral control chip set (or) I/O controller hub.

**EXPANSION SLOTS**

TYPES OF EXPANSTION SLOTS:

* ISA slot: Industrial Standard Architecture.

* PCI slot: Peripheral Component Interface.

* AGP: Accelerated Graphics Port.

**DRIVE CONNECTOR**

DATA CABLES: Data cables are used to transfer data between two different devices.

**A. IDE Cable- Integrated Drive Electronics:**

* 40 pins connector (ATA)

* Two connector in MBD four device can be connect with help of IDE cable

* IDE-I (Primary)Connector & IDE-II (Secondary)Connector.

* HDD, CD ROM, CD R/W, DVD can be connected.

* IDE Maximum Capacity 500gb and Data transfers at the rate of up to 133MB/s

**B. SCSI Cable- Small Component Standard Interface:**

* 50 pin connector (25+25=50 pins).

* 50 (for 8-bit SCSI) or 68 pin male (for 16-bit SCSI)

* It is used in server only.

* Capacity :16 TB and Data transfer rate 80 MBPS

**C. SATA Cable- Serial Advance Technology Attachme**

* 7 pin connector

* It is used to connect only one device.

* High capacity of Hard Disk can be connected.

* Maximum no. of devices - 4 devices and Capacity: 80 GB- 4 TB.

* Clamp side to be connect in motherboard and other side to be in HDD.

**BIOS CHIP [ROM]**

Types of BIOS Chip:

1. OTP: PROM [One Time Programmer].

2. FLASH: EPROM, EEPROM, FLASH MEMORY. [Re - programmer]

* PROM Programmable Read only memory (once programmed)

* EPROM Electrically programmable Read Only memory. Reprogrammed by using UV rays.

* EEPROM: Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory. Reprogrammable with software utility (DDO software).

* FLASH MEMORY: Now the Mother Board are made with Flash Memory. Hence we can upgrade the software easily.

**CMOS BATTERY [RAM]**
CMOS - Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor

* CMOS battery used for stand by the BIOS information maintain real time clock and password.

* It work as 3.3 volt DC.

**FRONT PANEL CONNECT**

The front panel connectors are :

1. Power Led (Green/Blue)

2. HDD - Led (Red)

3. Speaker - For beep sound

4. Restore switch (for restarting)

5. Power switch (On-Off switch).

**PORT CONNECTOR**

**A. SERIAL PORT**

* D Type 9 pin (male) port.

* Technical name : RS232

* Data transfer rate : 100 kbps.

* Unidirectional communication.

* It is used for connecting dial up modem & old type mouse.

**B. PARALLEL PORT**

* D Type 25 pins Female Port

* Data transfer rate : 100 kbps.

* Bi-directional communication.

* It is used for connecting Printer & Scanner.

**C. DIN PORT**

* 6 Pin DIN (Female) Port connector.

* Technical name : PS/2

* There is two of this port:

* MOUSE: Green - 6 pin DIN Connector

* KEYBOARD: Violet - 6 Pin DIN connector

**D. VGA PORT**

* 15 pins 3 rows D type Female Port connector.

* This port is actually called D-sub (D-subminiature) port and is mainly used by CRT and TFT.

* Monitors for receiving pure and loss less digital signals for display.

* That's the reason for it to be called Digital video Interface.

**E. ETHERNET PORT**

* 8 Pins Port connector.

* Technical name : RJ45

* Data transfer rate : 10 MBPS to 1000 MBPS

* This port is used for connecting the computer either to the Internet or to a private network such as LAN.

**F. USB PORT**

* 4 Pin multi device connector .

* It support up to 127 devices.

* Data transfer rate : 12 mbps - 60 mbps

* USB controller detect the presents and obscene of the devices.
