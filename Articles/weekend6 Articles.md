## Weekend-6 Articles


On sixth week I learnt about the while loop condition- A  while loop is a used to executes a block of code at least once or then repeately it executes the block.

And I learnt the for loop syntax- A loop is used for executing a block of statements repeatedly until a particular condition is satisfied.

Main difference for while loop and for loop- In while loop we should defined the variable separately in while loop syntax. for example let=a, let i=0, while(i>a), i=1+1.

In for loop we should defined the variable in one function itself. for example- for(let a=1, i<a, i++).And also i have learned that in javascript delete is something that delete one particular object.

"if statement"- if statement  is the condition we applying in the programing and it will say the true or false, ifthe true the program will execute otherwise we should use 'else' statement or we should use 'if else' but mostely we should not use else atatement or if else statements.

else statements- The else statements is the programming condition and it will use it in 'if statements' if the condition is false it will execute in the else statement

if else statements- The if else statements is the programming condition and it will use it in 'if statements' if the condition is false it will execute in the if else statement and it will execute for more conditions.

And I learnt that we should not use double equal to and we should use the trible equal to, sometime double equal to will not work in program ant it gives the wrong output, for example  "1==true:true" and "1===true:false" 

After that i am learnt about the some library function that function we can used it while coding the programming. The library function are:

* .shift()
* .pop()
* .push()
* .unshift()

* .shift()- it is used to push the first element out.
* .pop()- it is used to push the last element out.
* .push()- it is used to put an elements at the end of the array.
* .unshift()- puts an elements atthe beginning of the array.


Afterwards I learnt about how to built a programming code for tower of hanoi

steps for the tower of hanoi,

* step1- start

* step2- get the no of disk

* step3- find no of steps with (2^nod)-1

* step4- 1. move disk from A and B
	 2. move disk from A and C
	 3. move disk from B and C

* step5- check if no of moves is less than steps

* step6- else if check the nod id odd.

* step7- 1. move disk from A and C
         2. move disk from A and B
         3. move disk from B and C

* step8- check if no of moves is less than steps

* step9- stop

## Acruisition of skills

1. Impulsive skills
2. Imperial mind
3. Socialised mind
4. Self authoring mind
5. Self tranforming mind

## First senario: "When a person is given tasks which he/she cannot handle"

**Impulsive:**

They will try doing the task until it excites them, if not they move on to other tasks, they do not have care if the task is complete or not.

**Imperative:**

They will not be able to complete the task and they would justify that they have completed even if they haven’t.

**Socialised:**

They try to tell others and convince us by giving reasons why it wasn’t complete, they try to be more upfront why they cannot do the tasks.

**Self Authoring:**

They would be able to identify possible ways to handle them, they would ask for help if they needed. They only care about completing them. His authority would be to finish the work.

**Self Transforming:**

They would be able to identify possible ways and ask help from others and they would have authorship in the work they do. His authority would be in the work they do.


## Second senario: "A Person in a conflict relationship"

**Impulsive:**

They would leave and never consider to get back as they do take it to extreme ends during a conflict, they can not think logically and reason accordingly.

**Imperative:**

They will hold on to their side of the conflict and possibly find themselves right in their way despite of the scenario of the other person.

**Socialised:**

They talk to people based on the surrounding that they live in, they reason accordingly and not think beyond that.

**Self Authoring:**

They would be able to think and understand the problem but would not be able to relate to other person as they only would consider others but not the ideology.

**Self Transforming:**

They would understand the other person’s problems and try to convince others to come out of the ideology the other person lives in or embraces it.
