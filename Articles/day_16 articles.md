## Day-16 Refreshing Articles

On first day starting, we learnt about the basic fundamental skills to be a Engineer are Reading, Writing, Mathematical thinking, Problem solving, Researching, Breaking down and synthesing, Typing, Creativity.

Afterwards we learnt that what are the rules to be followed to be a software engineer, step to follow
	
	* First step to follow the **Novice**,that means we should follow the rules compulsory.
	* Next step to follow the **Advance Beginer**
	* Afterwards the except will follow the rules and they will break down the rules in some times.

Then i learnt that some command in the terminal in linux software, the commands are list,copy,to create a folder,to remove a folder,go back to folder,to create a text file in terminals,like etc...

By using these commands YUM,SUDO,Wget i learnt that, How to install the some software by using the terminals command.

After that i learnt that how to create a account in github and how to create a directory inside the github, How to add the github account in the terminals, by using the terminals how to push the articles into the github and by using github commands in terminals.
 
I learnt some steps while solve the Problem solving to write an algorithm, the steps are:

	* First we should understand the problems, for understanding we should read the problems two or three times otherwise read untill you understand the problem.
	* we should not avoid the problems.
	* Then we should identify list the constraints.
	* we should list all the possible operation while solving the problem.
	* Then we should arrange the operation to form a solution.

And i learnt some tips to find the solution for problem solving, the tips are:

	* we should find a way for the problems and its should be most constrained part.
	* Then we should try the trail and error method while doing the sum.
	* Afterwards break down the problems while doing the sum.
	* Then we should apply the correct strategy to do the sum,then we can able to find a solution for the sum.
	* Finally look for analogies.


I learnt that what is markdown languages and How to write it, What i was learnt in the markdown languages is- How to change the normal text into **BOLD**, *ITALIC* and ***BOLD ITALIC***.
In markdown languages, it contains the some rules and condition to apply for it, Then i learnt about the mark up languages.

After that they conducted the cultural tasks what is Responsibility and obligation and they convey the difference opinion in each group what i understood it the responsibility is the choosing some thing to do and the obligation i understood that some one is focing or giving some work to do, if they some one is forcing to do somethings, that time we should do it is in interest,if we do it in interest we can able to gain knowledge more and more.likewise I understood.

I learnt about the what is a first generation of computer?. The computer is used to compute, mostly they used for calculations and also used for to process the data and used to store the memory in a device. in before days the morse code are used to representing letters of the alphabet, numerals and punctuation marks by an arrangement of dots,dashes and spaces, these codes are used to transmitted the morse codes.

And i learnt about the data, the data is the collecting the information.
* Not needed
* useful for context/ useful for forming the algorithm
* What is needed for the algorithm to work

Evolution process in computer are: Mechanical-Electrical-Electronics-Quantum

This language is used in older days,its very hard to use and it has long processor to operate the first generation computers and day by day its changes to Binary number systems. The Method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols are 0-Zero and 1-One The eight bits is equal to the one bytes. A switch is used for ON OFF switch is called as a bit.

The clock speed is used for processor and the processor speed for per-second is equal to 2.4GHZ.

Normally for human we want 20HZ frequency, In TV they used normally 25HZ frequency, In computer they used the frequency in 60HZ,120HZ,144HZ
I learn about the Character sets. There are two types of character sets are availale, they are ASCII and UNICODE

After that they talk about Acruisition of skills.

1. Impulsive skills
2. Imperial mind
3. Socialised mind
4. Self authoring mind
5. Self tranforming mind

In this i was understood that The impulsive skills will have  for a childerns in the age between 1-14 age and the imperial mind will have all the middle age person, then the socialised mind will have middle age person and they will think about the community, The self authoring mind will have above the fourty plus age and finally self transforming mind will have only old persons (above seventy plus age).

I learnt about the why the all languages having space between the words? All languages having space in between the words, because the we can understand the words properly and all space will having the identity in a unique space.

In before days tamil is the only one language is available, from tamil language they seperated into many languages likely Malayalam and Telugu

In first they are created the the symbols/glyphs- These are the letters, after that symbols/gyphs they created the tokens that called as a words, after creation of tokens, they created the blocks. The blocks are contains the sentences in sentences they created the paragraph. In paragraph will have the space and new line space, after the paragraph it changes to pages, In pages is modified into chapters.

In before days they used some blocks to read the continue sentence without space.
