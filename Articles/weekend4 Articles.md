## Weekend-4 Articles

I learnt about the html command to build my resume in html formet while doing the html command i am facing many difficulties ater that i got some clarity.

The commands are i learnt is html tag, body tag, address tag, section tag, image tag, divide tag, backgroung color ,padding,color, likewise ilearnt many command.

And i am learning about what is data, the data is  collecting the information and specific about data are three types- Not needed (noise),
useful for context, what is needed for the algorithm to work and algorithm is also one kind of data.

After that i learnt about the relationship between data and operation. there is another three types of data are string, number, boolean these are called primitive data type because primitive data types are fundamental that we think of  and another one data type is called Novalue- it s null and undefined.i learnt about variable, the variable is used to store the value in a memory. 

And we learnt about the tokens for example-'Anoop is not giving me a coffee' this the one kind of sentence but tokens are Anoop, is , not, giving, me, a, coffee. these are the tokens after that we seperate into blocks.

The each computer having the compiler/Interpreters. The compiler and interpreter also a one kind of program. The interpreter is also called as translator and all comes under the binary form zero and once. for example C compiler is written in c language ang java script compiler is written in java script. the most of the programming languages are written in same language.

The compiler program is basically four major blocks are

	* Tokeniser and lexical analysis
	* syntatic analysis
	* sematic analysis
	* code generation

 
Tokeniser and lexical analysis- The tokeniser will break down into blocks and lexical analysis after break down it will check the meaning of the each tokens is having meaning or not.Example for tokenisor-'Anoop is not giving me a coffee' this the one kind of sentence but tokens are Anoop, is , not, giving, me, a, coffee. these are the tokens after that we seperate into blocks.


syntatic analysis- The syntatic analysis is one kind of structure and it will check the noun, verb, object, like etc. for example anoop felt ice cream

sematic analysis- The sematic analysis will check if any sentence does not having any meaning it will indicate the error, if the sentence having the meaning it will not indicate the error, after that the code will generate to next level.

code generation- if there is no error after that code will generate and the program will run.

i learnt that the values tokens are two types string literal and number literal. The string literal comes under double colon"...." and number literal comes under (0-9).

string- the string contains the number or a character is known as string, for example "hello india" and "Arjun003".

Number- The number is used to store the value in numericals in in the form of binary form and number is also one type of datatype.

Boolean- The boolean used to compare and tell whether the true or false and In programming the boolean having different syntax in each language, in java script it represented the true or false.

And i learnt about compiler and interpreter, they are the translator and it will convert the high level to the the machine code.

In english similarly we have noun, verbs, object so on in any language we take will have similar classification and coming to programming languages is similar to that.

In java script languages under identifiers there are 39 keywords is available and java script compiler knows only 39 words those words are called as keywords. by using this 39 keywords you are building more and more top of it.

In java script language these 39 keywords are be in a form of syntax, if the syntax is wrong it will indicates the error.

In  operator tokens they are nine operators in that nine operators i learnt one operator is assignments operators in assignment operator there are three types in that i learnt one is "equal=", the equal will assign the value to a variable.

Under 39 keywords  we have reserve words and everythings else.

"let" is the one type of keywords we used in java script, the correct  syntax is 'let a=5;' and let a,b,c,d; if we put wrong syntax it will indicates the error.example is 'let let;'.

data encapsulation- The data encapsulation is on of the some action requires in the programming for example switch is in ON and OFF state

And i learnt about the data structure, The data structure is the collection of array and string. we should defined the each object while structuring the any object,for example of data structure are table,library,conference room, like etc.

And the data structure is the one kind of design of any object.

Array- 

	* array is a collecting of any type of data.
	* array it contains the primitive data type are string, number,boolean
	* it has a composite datatype- combination of one or more types.
	* syntax of array should be in square bracket example- library= [a,b,c...]
	* Data stored in the array start with the indec of Zero example- let a= [0.1,2,3,...]
	* we can create, delete, update and read.

Object-

	* The object is the collection of key-value
	* the object will start with curly brackets for example-{a,b,c..}
	* it can be accessible through object keys


In cultural talks i understand some what, the responsibility and oblication every things comes under in your choice after that i learnt about 
Acruisition of skills.

1. Impulsive skills
2. Imperial mind
3. Socialised mind
4. Self authoring mind
5. Self tranforming mind

In this i was understood that The impulsive skills will have  for a childerns in the age between 1-14 age and the imperial mind will have all the middle age person, then the socialised mind will have middle age person and they will think about the community, The self authoring mind will have above the fourty plus age and finally self transforming mind will have only old persons (above seventy plus age).

In coming to children i learnt some what about sensori motor means that in small age we will do some unwanted things like we will go out with out informing that times some thinks happens to us we will not repeat it again and second stage of children is pre operational . In second stage of children will be age between two years upto seven years or more than that they will be observing and understanding in a symbolic ways.
after that children going to the next level of concrete operational and formal operational in that age of children they will learn by own and they will think by own.

In Adult there are two types 1.Transformation. 2.Subject Object Shift.

phases of minds: Stage 1 — Impulsive mind (early childhood) Stage 2 — Imperial mind (adolescence, 6% of adult population) Stage 3 — Socialized mind (58% of the adult population) Stage 4 — Self-Authoring mind (35% of the adult population) Stage 5 — Self-Transforming mind (1% of the adult population).
