## Day-12 Articles

On day 12, I learnt about procedure oriented programming. A programming paradigm that is based upon the concept of procedure calls and in the case of to develope a any application for a program.

* The program is divided into small parts is called function, In the case procedure oriented programming language to develop a program we have to divide the total program into some several number of parts and each and every parts ia called as function.

* The procedure oriented programming follows the Top-dowm approach in program design, In case of this the main program are executed in front after that sub program are executed and the program follows the Top to bottom.

* In procedure oriented language the program will start with high level language and end with low level language.

* The function and data can be written seperately and variable should be declared at the begining 

* There are no access modifiers in procedure programming

* Function can communicate by passing the parameters

* The case sensitive will differentiate the uppercase and lowercase

* semicolon are used to seperate the lines

* The curly braces used for to identify the loop and some condition

* In procedural language does not have any proper way of hiding data, so it is less secure, In case of we have to send the data one place to another place the data can be send in the form of plain text

The object oriented programming is a programming language in the concept of object.

* In object oriented programming to develope an application for a program we will use object and class

* In this program the object is divided into several number of parts and each part is called as an object

* The object  oriented programming follows the Bottom-up  approach in program design, In case first we should defined the class after that we should create an object for a class but program will run in the main function, the main function is called as object so its called as bottom up approach

* In procedure oriented language the program will start with low level language and end with high level language.

* The function and data are combined together form an object and variable should be declared at any where

* The object oriented programming has access modifiers are public, private, protected.

* Function can communicate with each other by passing the message

* The case sensitive will differentiate the uppercase and lowercase

* semicolon are used to seperate the lines

* The curly braces used for to identify the loop and some condition

* In object oriented programming provides data hiding, so it is more secure, In case of we have to send the data one place to a
nother place the data can be send in the form of plain text and it converted into cipher text.
