## Day 8 and 9 Articles

On Both days, I am learning about what is the Algorithm ? Algorithm is the set of rules to be followed in computer and its used for to solve the problems in problem solving. while writing the algorithm for any problems we should think more and more , in that what i learnt was we practice the more the problems we will know our mistake and we can rectife  the mistake easily.

while writing the algorithm for some problems we will be facing some difficuilties for that we should have some condition and tips for problem solving.

I learnt some steps while solve the Problem solving to write an algorithm, the steps are:

	* First we should understand the problems, for understanding we should read the problems two or three times otherwise read untill you understand the problem.
	* we should not avoid the problems.
	* Then we should identify list the constraints.
	* we should list all the possible operation while solving the problem.
	* Then we should arrange the operation to form a solution.

And i learnt some tips to find the solution for problem solving, the tips are:

	* we should find a way for the problems and its should be most constrained part.
	* Then we should try the trail and error method while doing the sum.
	* Afterwards break down the problems while doing the sum.
	* Then we should apply the correct strategy to do the sum,then we can able to find a solution for the sum.
	* Finally look for analogies.

### What is DATA ?

In computing, The data is used to collect the information. For that we need some condition to apply for it. The condition are

	* Not needed
	* useful for context/ useful for forming the algorithm
	* What is needed for the algorithm to work

Example for DATA- Add the two numbers 9 and 10, The data is 9 and 10

### Types of DATA

	* Arithmetic operation
	* Comparison operation

1. The Arithmetic operation are the numbers and The comparison operation are the Boolean.The boolean will check the true or false.
2. We can't able to do arithmetic operation in boolean.
3. Depending upon data we need the operation.
4. All doing a end of the day is the operation data.

Later they conducted the cultural tasks for an hour and they form an group to disscuss and tell about what is the difference between Responsibility and obligation and they convey the difference opinion in each group what i understood it the responsibility is the choosing some thing to do and the obligation i understood that some one is focing or giving some work to do, if they some one is forcing to do somethings, that time we should do it is in interest,if we do it in interest we can able to gain knowledge more and more.likewise I understood.

After that they talk about Acruisition of skills.

1. Impulsive skills
2. Imperial mind
3. Socialised mind
4. Self authoring mind
5. Self tranforming mind

In this i was understood that The impulsive skills will have  for a childerns in the age between 1-14 age and the imperial mind will have all the middle age person, then the socialised mind will have middle age person and they will think about the community, The self authoring mind will have above the fourty plus age and finally self transforming mind will have only old persons (above seventy plus age).
