<h1> Day-4 Articles in Internship </h1>     

<p> On day-4 morning session started, mentor put up a question, the question was what you learnt from day1 to till day3 and first question raises for me for that i told i learnt some command in terminals and he asked suddenly i can't able to give correct answer but i gaved the answer slightly to that, but others guys gives the answer continuously that time i thinking why i can't able to give more answer and that time i studies and realised that i want to improve my skills more and more. 

</p> <p>
After that we discussed about the bridge problems, i told the answer we can't able to solve the problems after that mentor raised the question why for i told we tried many constraints one by one to solve the problems that time we camed to an solution, for bridge problem there is a no solution for it, that time i learnt one thinks while practising more and more we will gain the more knowledge and one more thinks is we practise more we can easily judge the solution while reading the problems.The bridge problem was like euler's theorem.

</p> <p>
The mentor gaved another problems in haematogenous method to solve, The constrains for this problem is we should met the vertex point at only once, we discussed in a group. then we fined the solution easily,the solution we finded is first we should removed the all connected edges then it will be there only the vertex for identification we can put the numbers in vertex then we able to connected the line easily.

after we discussed with mentor we had a break for some times, after completion of break we started the session on the aternoon in that session was they taught that how to write the markup languages before that i don't know about the markup languages after coming to the intern i learnt that what is the markdown languages and i taught that markup languages and markdown languages are similar , yesterday only i got cleared that both are different laguages.The markup languages are XLM,HTML,YAML,JSON.Yesterday only i learnt that what are the markup language, in that i learnt that how to write the XLM-extensible markup languages like that all markup languages are similar only command will be changing.

later they conducted the cultural tasks for an hour and they form an group to disscuss and tell about what is the difference between Responsibility and obligation and they convey the difference opinion in each group what i understood it  the responsibility is the choosing some thing to do and the obligation i understood that some one is focing or giving some work to do, if they some one is forcing to do somethings, that time we should do it is in interest,if we do it in interest we can able to gain knowledge more and more. This is was yesterday i was understood.
