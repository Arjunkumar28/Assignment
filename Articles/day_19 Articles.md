## Day-19 Articles

On day-19 i learnt some html command to build my resume in that i learnt two types of formet first one is one column resume and second one is two column resume.

After that i learnt some what little bit basic of programming language, first things i learnt that while writing code we should be written in english language, if we think in tamil and we translated to english that is two step process when writing code, so i learnt that while writing code we should think in english and write in english.

In generally i learnt in english there is only one types of token is "word", in programming language there is three types of tokens are identifiers, value tokens, operator tokens.

The symbols are operator and punctuators combination of symbols and tokens it will create many blocks. The blocks are called as expressions.

In generally i learnt that the values tokens are two types string literal and number literal. The string literal comes under double colon"...." and number literal comes under (0-9).

In english similarly we have noun, verbs, object so on in any language we take will have similar classification and coming to programming languages is similar to that.

In java script languages under identifiers there are 39 keywords is available and java script compiler knows only 39 words those words are called as keywords. by using this 39 keywords you are building more and more top of it.

In java script language these 39 keywords are be in a form of syntax, if the syntax is wrong it will indicates the error.

In  operator tokens they are nine operators in that nine operators i learnt one operator is assignments operators in assignment operator there are three types in that i learnt one is "equal=", the equal will assign the value to a variable.

Under 39 keywords  we have reserve words and everythings else.

"let" is the one type of keywords we used in java script, the correct  syntax is 'let a=5;' and let a,b,c,d; if we put wrong syntax it will indicates the error.example is 'let let;'
